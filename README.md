# SnooViewer
(My) another attempt to continue making a uwp reddit client.
I choosed SnooViewer as codebase. I noticed that a few years ago that project worked (did api operations) normally (see that old, not mine, screenshot):

... but now original SnooViewer don't want show any posts. So, something went wrong... idk how to fix it. :(

## Current Status 
- Min. Win. os build = 15063
- Compilation/code building ok!
- Epic fail. Proper User-Agent needed... Reddit blocks access_token procedure (error 400 "bad request").

Note: I am not change the credentials found at this project. If I try to use my own credentials then I catch error 403 "invalid_redirect_url" :(


## ..
As is. RnD only.
